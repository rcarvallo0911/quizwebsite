        <h2>Witches</h2>      
        <p>Witches are amongst the most prominent creatures in folklore as they can be <br>
            seen in almost every culture portrayed differently. One thing that is universa<br>
             throughout, however, is a negative view on these creatures implying that they<br>
             have some sort of malevolent intent. These beliefs have lead to the spawn of many<br>
             terrible events in history such as the Salem Witch Trials and has even played a <br>
             part in the Spanish Inquisition!</p>

        <h2>Salem Witch Trials</h2>
        <h4>Folkore has been manifested through years and years of careful crafting and tradition.</h4>      
        <p>The Salem Witch trials took place between 1692-1693 in Salem, Massachusetts. It is said that the Witch hysteria started to occur after many young girls in Salem fell ill and had constant fits.  The Witch trials really took place, however, after 3 young girls were accused of witchcraft (Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborne). After Tituba, one of the accused, admitted that she was involved with the devil and witchcraft, tensions only strengthened and the Witch Hysteria grew larger. Since Salem consisted of many devout puritans, it only made sense that there would be witch trials to get rid of the “witches” within Salem.
            In order to come to the conclusion on whether or not someone was a witch, various tactics were used. Some of these tactics include dunking an accused witch into water until receiving a confession, searching for birthmarks or moles which were believed to be “Witch’s marks”, tieing up the accused to a chair and dunking them into water (if they floated they were a witch, otherwise they would drown), and the “Touch test” in which the accused would touch a sick person with fits and if that person calmed down that meant the accused was indeed a witch. In total, it is believed that about 20 people were executed and 100+ were sent to jails forced to live in terrible conditions.

            <h2>Spanish Inquistion</h2>      
            <p>Aside from the very famous Salem Witch Trials the Basque Trials during the Spanish Inquisition were just as bad, if not, even worse. The Basque Witch Trials occurred in Basque Spain between 1609-1614 and it is said that over 7,000 people were accused of Witchcraft. The trials began around 1609 in France when nearly 600 people were tried and almost 100 were executed. This lead to widespread panic and many people escaped to Spain, which caused even more panic because those who fled to Spain came from a place where witch trials were prominent. 
                Since the Spanish wanted to keep the Catholic Orthodoxy that they had been pushing for during the Inquisition, it was only natural for them to persecute witches as well. Not much is known on the full extent of the Witch Trials however it is is speculated that nearly 7,000 were tried and around a dozen had died.
