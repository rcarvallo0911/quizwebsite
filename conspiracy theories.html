          <p2>Over the decades, conspiracy theories have become more popular in our society.
        These conspiracy theories are mixed with facts and over imagination.
        <u><b>Conspiracy theories are theories that suggest that one secretive group controls and causes events and/or other situations.</b></u> 
        However, not everyone believes in these conspiracy theories.<b><u> Usually believers are the uneducated and unstable financially.</b></u>
        Although there are many different conspiracy theories in all topics that can affect everyone differently.
        Believers can be anyone, <u><b>it is really based on the mentality of the person</b></u> and the situation. 
        There are some people who are more prone to believing in conspiracy theories.
        <u><b>These people lack education like a graduate degree, probably are young or not very involved in society therefore lack experience, 
          and/or are overall very anxious or paranoid person.</b></u>
        Since believers/conspiriests can be anyone, there are many different types of conspiracy theories.
        Here we will talk about two of many popular conspiracy theories.

          <p3>A very popular conspiracy theory is that the July 20, 1969 Apollo mission was faked. 
          But why fake it? The reason most conspirators gave was that the <u><b>U.S. wanted to beat the Soviet Union at the Space Race to the moon.</b></u>   
            However some time afterwards people started to question the actuality of this event.
             <u><b>One thing that really surprised normal spectators was that there are no visible stars during the airing of the landing.</b></u> 
             Other evidence suggests that the televised broadcast was actually televising something similar to a movie set.
              For example, when the astronaunts sticked the American flag to the ground. 
              Most people noticed that it looked like there was wind on the moon, moving the flag.
              However, <u><b>NASA claims that the reason the flag looked like it was moving was because it was wrinkled by the way it was folded up.</b></u>

            <br><p5>Nelson Mandela supposed death in prison was the source of this theory. 
              <u><b>Named after him because many people were certain he died in prision during the 1980s, but ended up actually dying in 2013.</b></u>
               The Mandela Effect is a theory that attempts to explain the
               <u><b>phenomenon in which a large part of society remembers a different scenario or outcome of the past.</b></u>
               There are many variations of this theory, but the main one is that someone
                from the future is going back in time and making small changes in the orginal past.
              A situation like this is rare as most Mandela Effect instances <u><b>are actually minor or insignificant qualties of everday things.</b></u>
              An example of this is the Mona Lisa. Most people believed that orginally
              <u><b>the Mona Lisa was not smiling, but the current painting shows she is.</b></u>
