        <h2>Folklore</h2>     
        <p> From the beginning of time Folklore has been prominent in our society and has helped shaped many cultures. <br>
            Folklore is usually spread through years of tradition and word of mouth. Usually, Folklore stems out <br>
            of the desire to create an explanation for a strange or tragic event (like unexplained carbon monoxide <br>
            poisoning). Usually, there are various lessons to be learned with folklore which may still be relevant <br>
            today. Overall, Folklore’s influence can still be seen today within out media and society.

            <h2>Witches</h2>      
            <p>Witches are very important figures in media and played a key role in society, especially back then. Once such example of witches being integrated into media would be through art. For example, as many people in the U.S. were afraid of Communism and McCarthyism was prominent Arthur Miller wrote “the Crucible” to satirize how ridiculous the “modern witch hunt” was by comparing it to the Salem Witch Trials. Another example would be Francisco Goya’s art included witchcraft and witches during the Spanish Inquisition. Some other examples include the three witches in Macbeth & the witches in Hocus Pocus. Witches/witchcraft have also been used to explain terrible things in society such as the unexplained illness that struck in Salem Massachusetts causing many young women to have fits.

                <h2>Slavic Folklore</h2>    
                <p> Slavic Folklore has had an immense impact on Slavic culture as it was the reason for the formation of many new ideas and traditions. Take the Domovoi, for example, during this time period many were experiencing carbon monoxide poisoning despite not having a chimney. It was speculated that the Domovoi used its smothering ability to warn families that something was wrong in the house, therefore many believed that the domovoi was responsible for these unexplained poisonings. Another example would be a tradition formed as a result of one of these creatures, which was not burying those who were victims of drowning. Many believed that the Vodyanoi would take people into his realm in order to serve him. They felt that if they were to bury the person that it would upset the Vodyanoi. Lastly the Leshiy also had a great impact in that it taught many people to be wary of strangers lurking in the forest.
