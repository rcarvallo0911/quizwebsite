        <h2>Slavic Folklore</h2>      
        <p>Folklore from other cultures tends to be overlooked as it exists under the shadow of Roman <br>
          and Greek mythologies. However, although these stories are not necessarily prevalent in modern<br>
           media, their existence should still be taken into account and they should be treated with the<br>
            same respect that stories from Greece and Rome get. Slavic Folklore finds its roots in the <br>
            slavic region, and contains various mythological creatures like the Vodyani, Domovoi, and Leshiy.</p>

        <h2>Domovoi</h2>
        <h4>Although much lesser known than witches,</h4>      
        <p> the Domovoi was once a prominent figure within Russian Folklore and its existence was used to explain random unexpected deaths caused by… Unlike witches, the Domovoi is a harmless creature with no mal intent as it is meant to help with the domestic duties at home (hence its name standing for “the one at home”). The Domovoi can be very helpful as it loves to assist with the domestic duties of the house including caring for the families kin and cleaning up. However, the Domovoi can also be pesky at times as it may also steal things and gets upset whenever utensils or food are left at the table, and when swearing is used in the house. Many believe that the Domovoi was used to create an explanation for unexplained carbon monoxide poisoning. During this time, many people-especially those who lives in houses without chimneys, oddly enough-experienced carbon monoxide. As one of its duties, the Domovoi smothers people when they’re sleeping in order to warn them of dangers being present within the household.

            <h2>Leshiy</h2>      
            <p>The leshiy is another mythological slavic creature whose name can be translated to “THe one in the woods”. The leshiy can be found lurking the forest and enjoys playing pranks on people during it’s spare time. One of most infamous pranks includes making travelers lose their way by redirecting them onto the wrong path. In order to execute this successfully, the Leshiy will disguise itself as a relative or someone friendly and offers assistance to the traveler by telling them where to go, when really it is only leading the traveler onto the wrong path.

                <h2>Vodyanoi</h2>    
                <p> The Vodyanoi or "The one in the water" is a mythological creature that can usually be seen located near bodies of water such as lakes or rivers. The Vodyanoi is similar in appearance to a merman and enjoys communicating with humans. Although he does enjoy talking, that doesn't mean he is open to conversation with everyone as he dislikes talking to those who are prideful and enjoy bragging. This creature has had a significant impact on slavic culture because its existence explains why those who have drowned were not buried in Orthodox cemeteries. It was believed that the Vodyanoi would take these victims into his realm and make them his servants.
